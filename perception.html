       “Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes. It is the instant between the ticks of the watch; it is a void interval, slipping, forever, through time; the rupture between past and future; the gap at the poles of the revolving magnetic field, ultimately small but ultimately real.” George Kubler, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1962).
	<br><br> There are infinite integers between zero and one, and infinite states of being between the moment when we realize that what we’ve become is different from what we once were. This process of change is imperceivable but entirely real and only when looking back in time through memory can we truly observe change. We see time as points on a line rather than oscillating nodes; Our experience of the present is a limiting perspective. That undefined mediation contains every branching possibility. 
<br><br> In website hyperspace, a single site contains an eventual connection to every other site. “In cyberspace, all particles are present in the here and now. This changes our experience of time” (Sandbothe). Meanwhile, the entire web and ticks between seconds exist beyond that veil. 
<br><br>In this network, we can simultaneously exist on multiple maps, but it is still where we choose to spend each particular moment of experience that determines where we are (Otsuka). A site itself is superimposed with every other site, and the observer’s perspective and position in that network is the only thing that determines their reality. The present moment reflects the technology through which we access it (Otsuka). Our limited observation doesn’t negate the imperceivable layers of reality.
<br><br> Though we exist in multiple places, timelines, and states of being, we can only experience one. 

     <br><br>   "Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every possibility." <br>-Borges, <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i>
