       “Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes. It is the instant between the ticks of the watch; it is a void interval, slipping, forever, through time; the rupture between past and future; the gap at the poles of the revolving magnetic field, ultimately small but ultimately real.” George Kubler, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1962).
	<br><br> There are infinite integers between zero and one, and infinite states of being between the moment when we realize that what we’ve become is different from what we once were. This process of change is imperceivable but entirely real and only when looking back in time through memory can we truly observe change. We see time as points on a line rather than spaces oscillating in the hypercube. That undefined mediation contains every branching possibility. 
<br><br> In website hyperspace, a single site contains an eventual connection to every other site. “In cyberspace, all particles are present in the here and now. This changes our experience of time” (Sandbothe). Meanwhile, the entire web and ticks between seconds exist beyond that veil. 
<br><br>In this network, we can simultaneously exist on multiple maps, but it is still where we choose to spend each particular moment of experience that determines where we are (Otsuka). A site itself is superimposed with every other site, and the observer’s relativity determines their direct experience of the web. The present moment reflects the technology through which we access it (Otsuka). Our immediate observation doesn’t negate the layers of reality imperceivable.
<br><br> Though we exist in multiple places, timelines, and states of being, we can only experience one.
