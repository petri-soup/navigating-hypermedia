        	“The universe (which others call the Library)...” begins Borges’ 1941 speculation in his short story <a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf">The Library of Babel</a>. 
<br><br>Imagine a space of an infinite number of identical hexagonal galleries infinitely layered above and below you. Each hexagon has 4 walls filled with 5 bookshelves– 20 total– which are stacked floor to ceiling with the ceiling being your exact height. The remaining two walls of the hexagon are portals to the next identical gallery, a pathway you could take endlessly. 
<br><br>The architecture of the Library of Babel is not what makes it special. The books in these shelves contain every possible artifact of knowledge hidden in text of pure gibberish. These excerpts are organized in a way where each piece of information could have a direct line to another, if one is willing to dedicate an eternity to finding them. These hexagonal nodes can also be thought of an analog to web pages.   
<br><br><i>The library is a sphere whose exact center is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable.</i> <br>It is in a constant state of change and becoming. “Neither the Library nor the Internet has a fixed center. The Library is in a constant flux since each time a book is read it establishes connections to novel experiences and thus new links are established to other works" (Sasson). It contains all combinations of information including predictions of branching futures. This is compared to Borel’s infinite monkey theorem, in which monkeys hitting keys on a typewriter at random would, in an eternity, type out any known text.
<br><br><i>For every rational line or forthright statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense, and incoherency. </i> <br>No knowledge can be discovered in the library of Babel because it is shelved indefinitely with all other knowledge, including all falsehood. It’s a virtual copy of the universe, including its inherent flaws. “In the mirrored galleries, on the countless shelves, can be found everything and nothing. There can be no more perfect case of information glut” (Gleick). Searching for truth is futile because it is sat right beside all lies; In sum, this universe which contains all possibilities ends up being a repository of zero useful information. 
<br><br>The Tower of Babel in Genesis is afflicted with the same curse. Humans building a tower to the heavens once all spoke a single language. God, not wanting them to reach heaven, confused them with the fragmentation of their universal language into multiple languages so that they couldn't understand each other. With no way to continue building the tower, they dispersed across the earth and formed divided nations. Babel– both Library and Tower– is a place of information wealth to the point of uselessness. Information loses meaning in overabundance. 
<br><br>Some have theorized that the Library of Babel could only be useful when inputted into a quantum computer. To disprove this, a paper assessing the efficiency of a quantum librarian in Babel concludes that the exponential wealth of the library would be ruined, over time, by its exponential dilution (Castagnoli). 
	<br><br><i>If an eternal traveler should journey in any direction, he would find after untold centuries that the same volumes are repeated in the same disorder-which, repeated, becomes order: the Order.</i> <br>The goal of physics to find an underlying set of rules that all beings adhere to– from the smallest particles to the vastest universes. These rules are hidden, our limits of observation keeping them just out of reach. One can only see the patterns, the universal laws, by looking at the entirety of all knowledge.
