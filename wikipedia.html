        	The Wiki race is a challenge where you are given two random Wikipedia pages and, in the smallest amount of link clicks, you must reach one page from another. Sometimes the goal is always to reach the page for Jesus or death or something like that. 
<br><br>Another phenomena is that following the first non-italicized, non-parenthesized link of any Wikipedia page and repeating that process eventually leads to the article for philosophy. In February 2016, this was true for 97% of all articles on Wikipedia, according to Wikipedia. 
	<br><br>In Three Spaces by Wilhem Flusser, he writes:“For some time now we have had things that begin with the prefix “tele-,” which literally may mean “far” but which really means “to bring nearer.” Thus with the telescope we can bring things like the moon and the planets so near that they no longer look as if they are in cosmic space.” 
<br><br>In both of these challenges– the Wiki race and Philosophy phenomena– there is a sense that you are traveling a physical distance to get from origin to destination. You are jumping from one stepping stone to the next on a strategic path in an ocean of lava. You are bringing the final destination closer to you through every click of a link, teleporting between the pages in an instant. Wiki, after all, comes from the Hawaiian word for quick (wiki wiki), implying a traversal of distance. 
<br><br>In the creation of Wikipedia, the first mods considered themselves the heirs of Ptolemy in his gathering of scrolls for the library of Alexandria. However, instead of copying or stealing original texts, they summarize them apart from the individuals who previously thought it was theirs (Gleick). Through editing and annotation, these summaries become more elaborate over time, similar to the additions to the Talmud. They are a constant work in progress.
