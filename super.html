        In 1837, Charles Babbage designed the first device that would compute through a binary system of levers placed in an on and off state. 
	<br><br>He also thought that no motion is obliterated, with energy continuing its original entropy through all eternity. The laws of thermodynamics agree. Each atom, once disturbed, communicates its state to others, and they in turn influence waves of air and no impulse is entirely lost (Gleick). The future calculations of a machine are predictable from its initial state and the state of a system at one point in time immediately affects its next action. 
 	<br><br>“The air itself is one vast library, on whose pages are forever written all that man has ever said or woman whispered. There, in their mutable but unerring characters, mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest sighs of mortality, stand for ever recorded, vows unredeemed, promises unfulfilled, perpetuating in the united movements of each particle, the testimony of man’s changeful will.” <br>
– Babbage, “Exhumed and Exhaled”, 1837
<br><br>Babbage creates a representation of thought as physical particles. When each action has an eternal reaction, actions become immortal. Maybe these particles serve as a form of encryption, with each spoken word encoded in the vast atmosphere. The universe (which others call the library) takes a literal form in Babbage’s words. If these exertions of energy are recorded physically, could they be accessed by a decryption device? 
	When two particles are entangled, the qualities of one particle depend on those of another, no matter what lies between. When you know something about one of these particles, you immediately know something about the other, even if they are millions of light years apart. They are intrinsically linked with an invisible wire.
