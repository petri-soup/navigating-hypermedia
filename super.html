    In essence, a hyperlink is two interfaces contained inside each other even though they exist simultaneously in separate locations. A hyperlink brings the two pages closer together until they are one through connection. It seems paradoxical. 
<br><br>Two mirrors face each other, becoming infinitely closer until they identically reflect the light hitting them. If a particle were between these two mirrors, it would exist as its physical self but also as its two reflections– in three states at once. Here, we have an analog for the hyperlink and two website nodes. 
<br><br>We also have a wormhole. Spacetime is folded in half and a shorter pathway is formed between two points– separate places and timelines– so you can jump between. The image often used to describe this process is a crumpled up piece of paper. A flat piece of paper represents the 2D fabric of spacetime. Each timeline and location exists at a point on this paper. If you crumple the 2D paper into a ball, bringing it into a 3D space, two points that were once far away on the plane could touch. A connection is formed between them in the higher dimension that wasn’t possible on a 2D plane.
<br><br>Though wormholes are a speculation, comparing their anatomy to the internet makes things make sense. The internet is literally called the web, but webs are flat. If the internet is truly a web, hyperlinks would be constrained to a one dimensional pathway. Instead, hyperlinks are wormholes between two far away places and the internet is that crumpled up spacetime.
