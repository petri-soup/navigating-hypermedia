       The internet is seen as aspatial in conception because the only way we interact with it is through a screen interface that changes state by default– a property that attests physical objects. In reality, websites and digital goods are real bits located in physical storage that take up space and consume energy. 
<br><br>A bit is a combination of the words binary and digit. It is the smallest unit of information that a computer can process and store. The zeros and ones translate to on and off states of a physical circuit, magnetized poles, transistor, switch, or any other system that exists in two states. The bit is a translation between basic instruction to a physical action. 
	
Thumb drives use electrical circuits to store bits.
Hard drives and servers use magnetic polarization to store bits.
<br><br>Server farms take up hundreds of thousands of square feet. Many are in desolate deserts, a beacon of technological hub in a barren ecosystem. The dry climate helps to cool the servers that generate immense heat in their switching of tiny levers. Some servers are housed in watertight containers at the bottom of the cool ocean. <br>

<br><br>The fact that digital pages, wikis, videos, have a physical embodiment breaks down the false division that virtual is the opposite of real and digital the opposite of physical. Physical libraries like Alexandria are fragile, but the devices that store digital pieces decay over long periods of time in the same way that paper does.
